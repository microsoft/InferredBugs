    "message": "Caching support + Postgres LINQ count fix (again).\n\nAdded eager, lazy and lookup cache.\nNotifications are now synchronized with dispose on current server.\nThis fixes sync lag on current server.\n\nFix again for array_upper and context.\nNeed to use it for parameters since otherwise it will not work as expected on Postgres version without named parameters.\n\nCurrent cache renamed to WeakCache.\nAdded LookupCache which uses MemoryCache and it's configuration.\nAdded EagerCache which keeps data source up to date.\nAdded LazyCache which refreshes data source if it's out of sync.\n\nGuard for broken transactions - keep in transaction as true if transaction is broken.\nTransaction will become broken on database exception.\nCurrently database projects reference domain implementation (instead of interface) since it's not clear wheater Notify method should be part of public interface.\n\nTODO: Implement missing LRU cache\nTODO: promote IEagerNotification to interface project",

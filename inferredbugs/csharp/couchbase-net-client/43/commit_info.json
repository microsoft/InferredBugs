    "message": "Update management classes to use pools API\n\nMotivation\n-----------\nThe pools API gives all the information to construct the Cluster API\ncalls. This commit uses that information to construct the REST calls and\nrefactors/cleans up some duplicate code.\n\nModifications\n-------------\nThe ClusterManager now takes takes an IServerCOnfig in it's ctor and uses\nthe Controllers values to construct the URI. The construction of the URI\nis now done by one of two methods: GetApiURI and GetBucketApiUri. The\nControllers class was removed and replaced with a Controller class and the\nPools class modified to use a Dictionary of Controller classes from the\npools configuration.\n\nResult\n------\nThe Management API uses the correct source to generate it's URI's.\nDuplicate code has been refactored and is in general, easier to\nmaintain.\n\nChange-Id: Id2749a3576a90b80c9b8934274503bf407b61fd4\nReviewed-on: http://review.couchbase.org/47653\nReviewed-by: Jeffry Morris <jeffrymorris@gmail.com>\nTested-by: Jeffry Morris <jeffrymorris@gmail.com>",

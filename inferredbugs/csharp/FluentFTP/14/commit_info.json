    "message": "Fixed bug in socket polling code that was used to test for connectivity. Added new SocketPollInterval property (default 15 seconds) that is used to determine how much time should pass since the last read/write before the socket is Poll()'d for connectivity. Polling is used in conjunction with Socket.Connected because Socket.Connected still returns true even when the remote host has closed the connection.",

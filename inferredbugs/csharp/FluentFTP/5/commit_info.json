FtpDataStream's Read() method returns 0 if the stream is closed instead of throwing an IOException(). New code uses the file size to attempt to pre-determine EOF to work around issue with VxWorks FTP server which triggers an exception at EOF if the read buffer is larger than what's left to download.",

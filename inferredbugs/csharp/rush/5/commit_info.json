    "message": "Declare an \"activation mode\" enum instead of bool\n\nAlso applies a bit of cleanup during the change, such as:\n - Fixes misnamed `Configurations` folder (should be `Configuration` according to the namespace and is the correct one)\n - Removes *slightly arbitrary* default value of `UsingAutoFever`/`FeverActivationMode` in replay frames.\n - Replaces direct bind to fever activation mode config setting in `RushReplayRecorder` with basically the current value at `DrawableRushRuleset` (makes sense that way, since it's \"recording\" it).\n - Handle potential nullref on `RushFramedReplayInputHandler.{UsingAutoFever/FeverActivationMode}` while it accesses `CurrentFrame`.",

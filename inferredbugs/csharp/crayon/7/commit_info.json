    "message": "Add an implicit cast to function arguments when calling from a dynamically typed scope into a statically typed scope.\n\nThis only works when the function is known at compile time: constructors, base constructors, direct function references.\n\nFunction pointers and methods on ANY-typed variables still have no type verification. This will be addressed in a later commit.",

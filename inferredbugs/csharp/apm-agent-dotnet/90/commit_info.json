    "message": "Capture spans for new Azure Storage SDKs (#1484)\n\nThis commit captures traces for new Azure Storage SDKs.\r\n\r\nIn newer versions of Azure Storage SDKs, such as \r\nAzure.Storage.Blobs 12.9.0+, the destination url is\r\nno longer exposed on the operation activity. It is\r\nexposed on the Azure.Core child activity however. So, a listener\r\nis subscribed to listen for Azure.Core activities and copy the url\r\nfrom the child Azure.Core activity.\r\n\r\nSome newer versions of Azure Storage SDKs, such as\r\nAzure.Storage.Queues 12.7.0+, emit multiple activities for an individual\r\nmethod call, such as QueueClient.ReceiveMessage(). This\r\ncommit attempts to ignore duplicate activities when a trace\r\nhas already been started.\r\n\r\nFixes #1352",

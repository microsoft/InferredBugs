             NetStream.play(name, start, length, reset)
             - start An optional numeric parameter that specifies the start time, in seconds. This parameter can also be used to indicate whether the stream is live or recorded.
            	The default value for start is -2, which means that Flash Player first tries to play the live stream specified in name. If a live stream of that name is not found,
            	Flash Player plays the recorded stream specified in name. If neither a live nor a recorded stream is found, Flash Player opens a live stream named name, even 
            	though no one is publishing on it. When someone does begin publishing on that stream, Flash Player begins playing it.
            	If you pass -1 for start, Flash Player plays only the live stream specified in name. If no live stream is found, Flash Player waits for it indefinitely 
            	if len is set to -1; if len is set to a different value, Flash Player waits for len seconds before it begins playing the next item in the playlist.
            	If you pass 0 or a positive number for start, Flash Player plays only a recorded stream named name, beginning start seconds from the beginning of the stream.
            	If no recorded stream is found, Flash Player begins playing the next item in the playlist immediately.
            	If you pass a negative number other than -1 or -2 for start, Flash Player interprets the value as if it were -2.
            	
            - len An optional numeric parameter that specifies the duration of the playback, in seconds.
            	The default value for len is -1, which means that Flash Player plays a live stream until it is no longer available or plays a recorded stream until it ends.
            	If you pass 0 for len, Flash Player plays the single frame that is start seconds from the beginning of a recorded stream (assuming that start is equal to or greater than 0).
            	If you pass a positive number for len, Flash Player plays a live stream for len seconds after it becomes available, or plays a recorded stream for len seconds.
            	(If a stream ends before len seconds, playback ends when the stream ends.)
            	If you pass a negative number other than -1 for len, Flash Player interprets the value as if it were -1.
            
            - reset An optional Boolean value or number that specifies whether to flush any previous playlist. If reset is false (0), name is added (queued) in the current playlist;
              that is, name plays only after previous streams finish playing. You can use this technique to create a dynamic playlist. If reset is true (1), any previous play calls 
              are cleared and name is played immediately. By default, the value is true.
            	You can also specify a value of 2 or 3 for the reset parameter, which is useful when playing recorded stream files that contain message data. These values are analogous to 
            	passing false (0) and true (1), respectively: a value of 2 maintains a playlist, and a value of 3 resets the playlist. However, the difference is that specifying 2 or 3 for 
            	reset causes Flash Media Server to return all messages in the recorded stream file at once, rather than at the intervals at which the messages were originally recorded
            	(the default behavior).

{"hash": "14bcff071b472b0846a268dcf9dbe1b5c7709b4f", "message": "Fix or suppress all warnings reported by Findbugs\n\nThis changeset has a few things:\n\n* We switched the version of the BCEL library used by Maven for the\n  \"mvn site\" command, due to a bug in BCEL. Previously, this bug\n  preventd \"mvn site\" from running.\n* Enabled Findbugs to run when we do \"mvn site\". This makes it easier\n  to peruse the bug reports because we can look at the HTML. The HTLM\n  is imperfect: some bugs are only properly reported in XML files. But\n  it helps a lot.\n* Updated the maven findbugs plugin to 3.0.3 (previously 3.0.0)\n* Disabled warnings for unused fields because we had too many spurious\n  warnings.\n* Disabled two other warnings because we're right and Findbugs is too\n  conservative.\n* Fixed several warnings, including:\n  - Removed unused PostProcessingSpecification from QueryTask\n  - Null reference\n  - Missing default in switch\n  - Missing synchronization\n  - Field names that had wrong case. (They're unused, so not a\n    breaking change.)\n\nThis brings us down to zero warnings now.\n\nChange-Id: I2c30d42e73e0e0ab7def79910ec8805be7ab1be1", "file_num_lines": 468, "diff_parsed": {"added": [[179, "        // In practice, it's safe not to synchornize here, but this make Findbugs happy."], [180, "        synchronized (this) {"], [181, "            this.isStarted = false;"], [182, "        }"]], "deleted": [[179, "        this.isStarted = false;"]]}, "num_lines_added": 4, "num_lines_removed": 1}

Indeed\na style group is made to be updated, that is, you can specify several\ntimes a style rule in the style sheet with different (or the same) style\ndefinition. The style referenced by the rule will be augmented and\nmerged. However when the style does not reference any element, there\nwas bug when doing this. Since the CSS exists in GraphStream this never\nhappened !!!\n\nThis fix, corrects this bug, however there is another bug evidenced :\nThe code shown by Stefan sends twice the attribute \"ui.stylesheet\" to\nthe viewer. This bug will be corrected in a future commit.", "file_num_lines": 604, "diff_parsed": {"added": [[608, ""], [939, "\t\t\t\t\t\tif(group != null) {"], [940, "\t\t\t\t\t\t\tzIndex.groupChanged(group);"], [941, "\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshadow.groupChanged(group);"], [942, "\t\t\t\t\t\t}"], [967, "\t * Two cases :"], [968, "\t * <ol>"], [969, "\t *    <li>The style is an specific (id) style.

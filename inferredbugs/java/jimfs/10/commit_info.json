It's public, but it seems unlikely anyone's using it.\n-------------\nCreated by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe\nMOE_MIGRATED_REVID=112255563", "file_num_lines": 49, "diff_parsed": {"added": [[83, "   * Creates a new in-memory file system with a"], [84, "   * {@linkplain Configuration#forCurrentPlatform() default configuration} appropriate to the"], [85, "   * current operating system."], [86, "   *"], [87, "   * <p>More specifically, if the operating system is Windows, {@link Configuration#windows()} is"], [88, "   * used; if the operating system is Mac OS X, {@link Configuration#osX()} is used; otherwise,"], [89, "   * {@link Configuration#unix()} is used."], [96, "   * Creates a new in-memory file system with a"], [97, "   * {@linkplain Configuration#forCurrentPlatform() default configuration} appropriate to the"], [98, "   * current operating system."], [99, "   *"], [100, "   * <p>More specifically, if the operating system is Windows, {@link Configuration#windows()} is"], [101, "   * used; if the operating system is Mac OS X, {@link Configuration#osX()} is used; otherwise,"], [102, "   * {@link Configuration#unix()} is used."], [110, "    return newFileSystem(name, Configuration.forCurrentPlatform());"]], "deleted": [[80, "  /**"], [81, "   * The key used for mapping to the {@link Configuration} in the {@code env} map when creating a"], [82, "   * new file system instance using {@code FileSystems.newFileSystem()}."], [83, "   */"], [84, "  public static final String CONFIG_KEY = \"config\";"], [85, ""], [89, "   * Creates a new in-memory file system with a default configuration appropriate to the current"], [90, "   * operating system.

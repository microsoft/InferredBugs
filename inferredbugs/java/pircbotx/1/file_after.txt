/**
 * PircBotX is a Java framework for writing IRC bots quickly and easily.
 *  <p>
 * It provides an event-driven architecture to handle common IRC
 * events, flood protection, DCC support, ident support, and more.
 * The comprehensive logfile format is suitable for use with pisg to generate
 * channel statistics.
 *  <p>
 * Methods of the PircBotX class can be called to send events to the IRC server
 * that it connects to.  For example, calling the sendMessage method will
 * send a message to a channel or user on the IRC server.  Multiple servers
 * can be supported using multiple instances of PircBotX.
 *  <p>
 * To perform an action when the PircBotX receives a normal message from the IRC
 * server, you would override the onMessage method defined in the PircBotX
 * class.  All on<i>XYZ</i> methods in the PircBotX class are automatically called
 * when the event <i>XYZ</i> happens, so you would override these if you wish
 * to do something when it does happen.
 *  <p>
 * Some event methods, such as onPing, should only really perform a specific
 * function (i.e. respond to a PING from the server).  For your convenience, such
 * methods are already correctly implemented in the PircBotX and should not
 * normally need to be overridden.  Please read the full documentation for each
 * method to see which ones are already implemented by the PircBotX class.

/**
 * The ClientTransaction class retransmits (what a surprise) requests as
 * specified by rfc 3489.
 *
 * Once formulated and sent, the client sends the Binding Request.  Reliability
 * is accomplished through request retransmissions.  The ClientTransaction
 * retransmits the request starting with an interval of 100ms, doubling
 * every retransmit until the interval reaches 1.6s.  Retransmissions
 * continue with intervals of 1.6s until a response is received, or a
 * total of 9 requests have been sent. If no response is received by 1.6
 * seconds after the last request has been sent, the client SHOULD
 * consider the transaction to have failed. In other words, requests
 * would be sent at times 0ms, 100ms, 300ms, 700ms, 1500ms, 3100ms,
 * 4700ms, 6300ms, and 7900ms. At 9500ms, the client considers the
 * transaction to have failed if no response has been received.
